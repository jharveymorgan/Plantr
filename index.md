### Project Idea
Everyone wants fresh food and there is nothing fresher than something grown in your own backyard. However, not everyone likes actually getting their hands dirty. That’s why we created Plantr, your new gardening assistant. Simply drive this modified RC Car around your garden and drop seeds, fertilizer, and water like a pro. 

### Materials
* ~5 sq ft of 1/4” wood
* ~4 sq inch of acrylic
* RC Car
* 4 nuts and bolts
* DC motor
* 2 Arduino Nanos
* 2 Adafruit Bluefruit UART Low Power Bluetooth
* 2 Power MOSFETS
* 1 Solenoid Valve



### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jharveymorgan/Plantr/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
