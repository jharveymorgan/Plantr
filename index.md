## ECE 4180: Plantr

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jharveymorgan/Plantr/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Project Idea
Everyone wants fresh food and there is nothing fresher than something grown in your own backyard. However, not everyone likes actually getting their hands dirty. That’s why we created Plantr, your new gardening assistant. Simply drive this modified RC Car around your garden and drop seeds, fertilizer, and water like a pro. 

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jharveymorgan/Plantr/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
